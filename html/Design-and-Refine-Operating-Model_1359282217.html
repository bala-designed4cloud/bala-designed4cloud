                    <p>Let be realistic, by moving to public Cloud, you are only moving your physical infrastructure to someone else’s data centers, so only the physical infrastructure need not be be managed, but all other aspects remain with you as a customer, that includes:</p><ul><li><p>All your platforms such as databases, middleware, data, reporting, security and events management and any other platforms that are relevant for your day to day operations.</p></li><li><p>The service management across all of your services, the cloud providers won’t and can’t manage your services, they provide primitive cloud services such as compute, disk, storage etc., but it’s up to you to create a composite application including all of the cloud provider services and manage your final product as a service within your SLAs. </p></li><li><p>By moving to cloud you are extending your technology portfolio into cloud, unless you completely decommission everything on-premise and all your access are going to be only over internet. This means you will need people not only to understand and manage your on-premise infrastructure, but you also need people to understand and manage cloud and connectivity between cloud and on-premise.</p></li><li><p>As your technology portfolio is extended into cloud, which is someone else’s data center you are also increasing your security risks, which needs to be managed with modern eye as you are now in someone else’s premises potentially alone with your competitor’s or a hacker’s compute instance.</p></li></ul><p>These are few considerations before you start defining/refining your operating model before moving into cloud. It’s most critical step and should be done prior to moving into cloud not after the fact!</p><p>Please <a href="Contact-Us_1358462994.html" data-linked-resource-id="1358462994" data-linked-resource-version="8" data-linked-resource-type="page">Contact Us</a>  should you like to have a free consultation with no obligations. The operating model is your engine and fuel to have a smooth cloud journey and you must get it right to make it enjoyable!</p><p />
